This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**. Each project highlights key OOP concepts like:

- 🏛️ **Classes and Objects**
- 🔄 **Inheritance** (including all levels)
- 🌀 **Polymorphism** (static and dynamic)
- 🔐 **Encapsulation**
- 🎨 **Abstraction**
- 🤝 **Friend Functions and Classes**

---

### 🚀 Features

These projects leverage advanced C++ features, including:

- 📂 **fstream** library for file handling
- 🔢 **Static Data Types** for efficient memory management
- ⚙️ **Functions** and **windows.h** free-built functions
- 🎞️ **Console Animation** using **windows.h**
- 🤝 Practical implementations of **friend functions** and **friend classes**

---

### 🌟 Why These Projects?

These examples provide practical, hands-on demonstrations of OOP principles, helping you understand how to apply them effectively in real-world **C++** scenarios. Explore the code and take your **OOP** skills to the next level! 💡
