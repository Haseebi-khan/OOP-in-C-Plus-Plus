# 🎉 Welcome to the OOP in C++ Projects Repository! 🚀

[![OOP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Concepts-OOP-blueviolet.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**. Each project highlights key OOP concepts like:

- 🏛️ **Classes and Objects**
- 🔄 **Inheritance** (including all levels)
- 🌀 **Polymorphism** (static and dynamic)
- 🔐 **Encapsulation**
- 🎨 **Abstraction**
- 🤝 **Friend Functions and Classes**

---

### ⚠️ Compatibility Note

**This project can only run on Linux distributions.** If you want to run it on Windows, you will need to modify the Linux-specific functions found in the `windows.h` built-in library. The window-based functions that require changes are documented in the repository under the name [UI_OwnLibrary_C++](https://github.com/Haseebi-khan/Object-oriented-programming-in-C-Plus-Plus/tree/main/UI_OwnLibrary_C%2B%2B/UI_OwnLibrary_C%2B%2B).

### 🚀 Features

These projects leverage advanced C++ features, including:

- 📂 **fstream** library for file handling
- 🔢 **Static Data Types** for efficient memory management
- ⚙️ **Functions** and **windows.h** free-built functions
- 🎞️ **Console Animation** using **windows.h**
- 🤝 Practical implementations of **friend functions** and **friend classes**

---

### 🌟 Why These Projects?

These examples provide practical, hands-on demonstrations of OOP principles, helping you understand how to apply them effectively in real-world **C++** scenarios. Explore the code and take your **OOP** skills to the next level! 💡
