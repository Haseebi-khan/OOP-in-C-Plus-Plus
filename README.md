# Welcome to the OOP in C++ Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of projects that illustrate key principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**. Each project highlights different fundamental OOP concepts such as:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance** (including all levels)
- **Polymorphism** (static and dynamic)
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**
- **Friend Functions and Classes**

Additionally, these projects utilize a variety of advanced C++ features, including:

- **fstream** library for file handling
- **Static Data Types** for efficient memory management
- **Functions** and **windows.h** free-built functions
- **Console Animation** using **windows.h**
- Practical implementations of **friend functions** and **friend classes**

These projects provide practical examples that demonstrate how to apply OOP concepts effectively in real-world scenarios.
